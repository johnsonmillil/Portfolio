## About Me
I’m passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights and scalable solutions. I enjoy tackling challenges at the intersection of data, cloud, and software engineering. Outside of coding, I thrive on continuous learning, whether that’s experimenting with new ML algorithms or optimizing cloud deployments. My goal is to apply data science to solve real-world problems that create measurable business and social impact.
