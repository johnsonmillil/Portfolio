# Hospital Readmission Dashboard

## Overview
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing hospital readmissions from medical_clean.csv, identifying patterns (e.g., long stays, risk factors) for operational improvements.

## Approach
- Visuals: KPI (36.7% rate), scatter plot (stays vs. charges), map (by state), table (risk factors).
- Interactivity: Filters for state/age, map actions.
- Accessibility: Blue-orange palette for colorblind users.

## Technologies
Tableau, Python (for prep).

## Results
| Metric          | Value          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Readmission Rate| 36.7%          |
| Avg Stay (Readmit)| 63.86 days     |

## Learnings
Storytelling via narrative structure engaged audiences; verbal descriptions ensured accessibility.
